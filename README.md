# 🛒 E-Commerce Recommendation System with Flask & Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project is an **E-Commerce Product Recommendation System** built with **Flask** and **Machine Learning**. It suggests products to users based on their preferences and behavior using multiple recommendation strategies:

* **Content-Based Filtering**
* **Collaborative Filtering**
* **Hybrid Recommendation**
* **Rating-Based Recommendations**

The system can be integrated into any e-commerce platform to enhance the user experience by providing **personalized product suggestions**.

## 🚀 Features

* 🔍 **Content-Based Recommendations** – Suggests products similar to those a user has interacted with.
* 🤝 **Collaborative Filtering** – Uses other users’ preferences to make predictions.
* 🔄 **Hybrid Approach** – Combines multiple algorithms for better accuracy.
* 🧠 **Multi-Model Recommendations** – Uses different ML models to cater to diverse needs.
* 🌐 **Flask Integration** – Web-based interface for user interaction.
* 🔑 **User Authentication** – Secure sign-up/login with session management.
* 🛍 **Product Browsing & Search** – Explore products with images, descriptions, prices, and ratings.
* ❤️ **User Feedback Loop** – Users can like, rate, and review products.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python, Flask
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
* **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow
* **Database:** SQLite / MySQL (configurable)
* **Recommendation Algorithms:** Content-based, Collaborative filtering, Hybrid, Multi-model

## 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git https://github.com/abhay34-ai/Ecommerace-Recommendation
cd Ecommerace-Recommendation
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Prepare the dataset**

   * Place your e-commerce dataset inside the `data/` folder.
   * Update the dataset path in `recommendation.py` if needed.

5. **Run the Flask app**

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will be available at: **[http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)**

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleans and structures dataset (products, users, ratings, interactions).
2. **Model Training** – Uses ML algorithms to build recommendation models.
3. **Flask Integration** – Displays recommendations on the website dynamically.
4. **Feedback Loop** – Updates recommendations based on new ratings and interactions.

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Add **real-time recommendations**.
* Implement **deep learning-based ranking models**.
* Use **NoSQL databases** for scalability.
* Deploy on **Heroku / AWS / Azure**.
